# Topic Modeing

Topic Modeling is a text-mining technique. This method is categorized as
unsupervised learning in the Machine Learning literature.

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a state-of-the-art implementation of Topic
Modeling that proposes a generative process to model the collection of discrete
textual datasets. LDA tries to classify documents based on their similarities
into groups by capturing their semantic relations.

LDA has several realizations via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Variational
Bayes (VB) method, Expectation Maximization (EM), Likelihood Maximization, and
several hybrid methods. In [this](http://jsdp.rcisp.ac.ir/article-1-1228-fa.html)
paper, we propose a novel interpretation of parameters and latent variables and
the Iterative Variational Bayes (IVB) method. We provide detailed proof of
updating rules in the appendix section of the paper as a supplementary.

We share all implementation and source codes in this repository. You can access
